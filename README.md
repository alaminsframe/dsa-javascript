## Introduction

This repository contains various Data Structures and Algorithms written in JavaScript. The goal is to help beginners and intermediate learners understand DSA concepts by providing easy-to-understand implementations and explanations. Each folder represents a different DSA category with examples.

## Data Structures

The following data structures are implemented:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, etc.)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are included:
- Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Dynamic Programming (Fibonacci, Knapsack Problem, etc.)
- Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra, BFS, DFS, etc.)
- Other Algorithm Techniques

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alaminsframe/dsa-javascript.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd das-javascript
   ```

3. Run JavaScript files directly or use Node.js for running scripts:
   ```bash
   node <filename.js>
   ```

4. Explore different data structure implementations or algorithms by opening the respective files in the directory.

**Note**: Ensure you have Node.js installed to run the JavaScript code locally.
